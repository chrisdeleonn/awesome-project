# Starting the React Project

    Built in React by a Car enthusiast, here are some simple steps to navigate through the full stack web application.

    Who's it for? People who need a digital folder for their car repairs and modifications.

    Once on the page, hover over the side menu, and under parts, select a category via the drop-down menu, enter the date of when the repair happened, and the brand.

    Click refresh, and the history of entries show up on the right side of the page.
